# transfer-learning
This project demonstrates the application of Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning using the pre-trained VGG16 model to classify 102 species of flowers from the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, training of the base model with frozen layers, and a fine-tuning stage for performance optimization.
